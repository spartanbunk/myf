## Current Implementation Status

### Starting Phase 1: Foundation Components

**Current Task**: Enhancing CatchCard Component with Action Buttons

**Next Steps**:
1. Add action button props to CatchCard component
2. Implement overlay and bottom positioning variants
3. Add new event emitters
4. Create DeleteConfirmationModal component
5. Test foundation components before proceeding

## File Structure Changes

### New Files to Create:
```
src/components/
â”œâ”€â”€ common/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ DeleteConfirmationModal.vue (NEW)
â”œâ”€â”€ modals/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ CatchViewModal.vue (NEW)
â””â”€â”€ IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md (THIS FILE)
```

### Files to Modify:
```
src/components/
â”œâ”€â”€ common/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ CatchCard.vue (ENHANCE)
â”œâ”€â”€ maps/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ LogCatchModal.vue (SIMPLIFY)
â”œâ”€â”€ views/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Dashboard.vue (UPDATE)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Catches.vue (UPDATE)
```

## Technical Notes

### Component Event Flow:
```
CatchCard (@view/@edit/@delete) 
    â†“
Parent Component (Dashboard/Catches)
    â†“
Modal Management (CatchViewModal/LogCatchModal/DeleteConfirmationModal)
```

### Backward Compatibility:
- Existing `@click` event maintained during transition
- Can gradually migrate components to use new action system
- No breaking changes to existing implementations

## Testing Checklist

### Phase 1 Testing:
- [ ] Action buttons appear correctly on hover (overlay mode)
- [ ] Action buttons appear at bottom (bottom mode)
- [ ] Events fire correctly (view/edit/delete)
- [ ] DeleteConfirmationModal opens and functions
- [ ] Mobile touch targets work properly
- [ ] Accessibility features function correctly

### Integration Testing:
- [ ] Dashboard recent catches use new action system
- [ ] Catches page grid view uses overlay actions
- [ ] Catches page list view uses bottom actions
- [ ] All modals open correctly from new buttons
- [ ] Modal state transitions work smoothly
- [ ] Delete confirmation prevents accidental deletions

### Performance Testing:
- [ ] No regression in component render performance
- [ ] Modal opening/closing is smooth
- [ ] Mobile performance is acceptable
- [ ] Large catch lists perform well

## Implementation Timeline

**Estimated Duration**: 3-4 hours total
- **Phase 1**: 1 hour (Foundation)
- **Phase 2**: 1 hour (View Modal)
- **Phase 3**: 1 hour (Integration)  
- **Phase 4**: 0.5-1 hour (Polish)

**Starting**: Now
**Target Completion**: Today

## Success Criteria

### User Experience:
âœ… **Clear Actions**: Users can easily View, Edit, or Delete catches
âœ… **Rich Presentation**: View modal shows catch data with "bells and whistles"
âœ… **Intuitive Flow**: Edit goes directly to edit mode, no confusion
âœ… **Safe Deletion**: Confirmation modal prevents accidental deletions

### Technical Quality:
âœ… **Component Reusability**: Enhanced CatchCard works across all pages
âœ… **Maintainable Code**: Clear separation of concerns
âœ… **Performance**: No regression in app performance
âœ… **Mobile Ready**: Touch-friendly on all devices
